	<h2>Passion for the Web</h2>

	<p>
		One common thread that runs through all our team is a passion for creating great web-sites. We love websites that are a pleasure to use, and we love to make them even more. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We believe strongly that good websites should be fun to use and believe that one of the key ingredients to building great websites is in maximising the momentum of the user&apos;s experience. To achieve this we mimimise the amount of friction (filling in forms and clicking on links) and maximise on momentum (present content in an interesting and intuitive manner) to provide a superior user experience.

	<h2>Experience</h2>

		As a team we come with a wide array of web industry. We have experience with large and small web-sites, with creative and functional web-sites, with fast-paced and sure-and-steady web-sites. We have experience in the E-Commerce field with <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, in the Energy Utilities Billing industry with <a href="http://www.hsntech.com">Hansen Technologies</a> and with many small to medium sized enterprises.

	<h2>Agile Development</h2>
	<p>
		We choose to run our projects in small focused groups following the Agile Development principles (see below) where possible. This means we operate in shorter development iterations in close coordination with our clients. This translates to visible results sooner for our clients that are more closely aligned to their expectations.

	<h2>Principles of Agile Development</h2>
	<p>
		Some of the principles behind the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Manifesto</a> are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software</li>

		<li>Working software is the principal measure of progress.</li>
		<li>Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.</li>
		<li>Close, daily, cooperation between business people and developers</li>
		<li>Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.</li>
		<li>Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted</li>
		<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.</li>
		<li>Simplicity</li>
		<li>Self-organizing teams</li>
		<li>Regular adaptation to changing circumstances</li>

	<h2>Colophon</h2>
	<p>
		The fabulous Kennedia bird that is the adopted logo of Kennedia Consulting is the work of Pitimati Nimmanheminda at <a href="http://deadspy.com/">dead.spy</a>. It was created for the original iteration of Kennedia.com - back in the day when it was a blog/portfolio site.
