We build web-sites and iOS mobile apps that work. Our focus is on standards, high visibility, high quality, superb user experience and short development times. We always strive to keep solutions as simple as possible whilst maintaining these standards.

We happily operate in both Mac OSX and Unix environments and choose to use platforms like Ruby on Rails, or NodeJS for Unix/OSX and Objective-C of iOS Mobile development.

## Standards

We believe that adhering to standards is important as it makes web-sites and mobile apps more accessible to more users. If you follow standards you can be sure that more people will be able to use and consume the content you are providing. Also, in a time of accelerating technological change the importance of longevity is increasingly important. Adhering to web-based standards ensures web-sites do not date and become obsolete nearly as fast as would proprietary presentation methods (like Flash). Longevity means a greater return on investment.

## On Ruby

We use Ruby more and more as our clients enjoy the benefits it produces. Ruby on Rails has become a mature web development framework that allows us to develop web-sites faster and better than ever before and we've been using it since v1.0.

Faster and better translates to our clients as higher quality for less money - more bang for you buck.

## Small and Fast

Using Ruby (with or without Rails) also fits snugly with our preference for developing using the Agile Development principles. We can produce results faster and in smaller iterations. Our clients are always happier to get more output for less money, and this allows us to offer that in an effective way.
