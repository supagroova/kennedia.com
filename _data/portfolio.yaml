      Mintd is a global collaborative space for artists, designers and musicians to sell their work and connect to new markets. We think it fills a space in online indie retails that until now was left wide open. There is very little in the way of community based market places for up-and-coming creative designers. Connecting direct to the buyer, the seller can deliver goods at a reasonable price. Mintd allows niche markets to form and flourish.
