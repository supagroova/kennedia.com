    Hey Walkies is a website and iphone application designed to bring people and puppies together. While dog owners may know the whereabouts of dog parks in their own neighborhoods, as of yet there is not a resource for locating dog parks around the city. Hey Walkies helps owners find parks for their dogs to play in wherever they may be in NYC. Hey Walkies also taps into Facebook, bringing the world's largest social network to the people and pups that use our site.
    
    Apple loved Hey Walkies so much that they decided to feature it in their "Dog Lovers" TV commercial. [Watch the commercial here](http://www.youtube.com/v/0tmcNcTNzxA).

      Evisu approached Kennedia to help improve their online store. The first step was to create a new dynamic store locator to proceed their United States drive to open new stores. Kennedia developed a smooth and exciting mini-app that allowed Evisu to manage their store location in a back-end admin section (integrated with their existing system software) and let users browser through the stores stocking evisu products all over the world. It also integrates the amazing Google Maps system to allow users to pinpoint store locations and get instructions on how to get there from their own location.
      
      Since the success of the Evisu Store Locator Kennedia has been closely involved in the continuing process of improving the Evisu.com website and assisting them in bolstering their online sales.

      ODD is an design agency in London who were seeking to re-brand and strengthen their web presence. They wanted the ability to control the content of their website to allow them to keep it's content up-to-date with their blistering progress. They wanted the smooth sexiness of Flash but also visibility to search engine.
      
      ODD Kennedia Consulting was approached to solve their requirements and together in consultation with ODD developed an administration backend to their public web-site. The website features numerous flash animations which when viewed by non-flash browsers (like search engines) still display the content in a desirable fashion this mix gave the site visual appeal and content visibility. The website was developed solely by Kennedia Consulting using Ruby on Rails and MySql and a rich mix of Flash and HTML with cutting-edge Javascript. ODD were especially happy with the output and the speed of delivery.

      Mintd is a global collaborative space for artists, designers and musicians to sell their work and connect to new markets. We think it fills a space in online indie retails that until now was left wide open. There is very little in the way of community based market places for up-and-coming creative designers. Connecting direct to the buyer, the seller can deliver goods at a reasonable price. Mintd allows niche markets to form and flourish.
      
      Mintd is a sophisticated community/e-commerce platform built in Ruby on Rails. It allows sellers to create virtual online stores and begin selling products for free. The platform promotes health community communication and contribution

      The Basecamp Widget is an Apple Dashboard Widget that connects to Basecamp a web-based project management application produced by 37signals. This widget allows you to conveniently access your Basecamp projects from your desktop. At Kennedia Consulting we use Basecamp for all our projects and we all use OS X for most of our work so having access to our projects right on our desktop is a great help. The widget was released as free software in the hope that it would help many other Basecamp users as well.
      
      The widget proved so popular that within the first week of release it had accumulated almost 10,000 downloads, had been featured in The Unofficial Apple Weblog and other blogs, ranked 23rd in the Apple Widget Top 50 downloaded widgets, and was chosen as an Apple Staff Favourite widget.
