After having launched [PrePlay](http://preplaysports.com) with The 88 and later through Le 88, we're very excited to announce that Le 88 will be joining PrePlay and setting up their development center in Paris.

Kennedia's principle [Lachlan Laycock](http://www.lachlanlaycock.com) will be heading the team as both CTO of PrePlay and President of the Paris subsidiary.

Look forward to see lot's more exciting developments for PrePlay now we'll be working full-time with them!
