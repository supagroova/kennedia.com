After many successful projects with Jackson Laycock we're once again thrilled to announce the introduction into the agency of a new founder and creative director [Harry Bernstein](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/harry-bernstein/28/300/7b6). Bringing Harry on board is a very exciting event for us and will help us fill out aspects of the agency and bring us further toward a full-service agency.

To mark this occasion we've also decided to rename the Agency to [The 88](http://lovethe88.com). We already have a number of exciting projects in the pipeline - Bring on the goo	d times!
