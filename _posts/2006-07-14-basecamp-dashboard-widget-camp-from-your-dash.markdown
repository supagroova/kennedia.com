We use 37signals great project management web-app basecamp ALL the time. Upon noticing that they had released and API to their system, we couldn't resist doing something with it. The Kennedia [Basecamp Dashboard Widget](https://github.com/supagroova/basecampwidget) is being made available to beta testers and will be publicly available soon. Look out!
